Here are slides from a talk I gave at BarcampGR 2013.

There are tons of great resources for electronics beginners to learn Arduino, and its ecosystem is designed to have a smooth progression to production hardware, but there aren't so many resources for people who are comfortable with Arduino and want to make the leap to general microcontrollers.

My talk covered important skills like reading data sheets, finding needles in the hyperdiminsional haystack that is the Digi-Key catalog, and surface-mount soldering, as well as the tools and software toolchain that become necessary once you step outside of the Arduino platform.

Plenty of links are included as comments in the markdown file.
